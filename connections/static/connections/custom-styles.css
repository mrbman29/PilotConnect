It looks like there might be a syntax error in your CSS file. The closing curly brace for the .custom-event-name-input class is missing. Additionally, there's a missing closing curly brace for the .form-control-wide class. Here's the corrected version:

css
Copy code
/* custom-styles.css */

/* Adjust the width of the Event Name input field */
.form-control-wide {
    width: 100%;  /* You can adjust the width as needed */
}

.custom-event-name-input,
.custom-event-description-input,
.custom-content-input {
    width: 50%;
}

.custom-subject-input {
    width: 50%;
}
